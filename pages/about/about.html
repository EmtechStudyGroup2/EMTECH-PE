<h4> How do you use this application? </h4>
<p> All you have to do is basically place what your biological sex is, what your current height is in centimeters, what your weight is right now or what weight you wish to earn, your age, and finally, how much you exercise in a day. After placing the basic information required, the application will show everything for you!  </p>

<br/>

<h4> Ever wonder how the application calculated your intake? </h4>
<p> That's easy! The application made use of the Miffin - St Jeor equation. The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is achieved first. It differs between males and females. Your weight in kilograms is multiplied to 10 and then it is added to the product of your height in centimeters and 6.25. It is then subtracted to the product of your age and 5. If you are a male, the difference of the last equation is added to 5. If you are a female, the difference of the last equation is subtracted by 161 instead of adding to 5. </p>

<p> Your BMR is then multiplied to a factor by your daily activity level. If you don't exercise that much, it is multiplied to 1.2. If you exercise for one or two days per week, it is multiplied to 1.4. If you exercise for two or three days, it is multiplied to 1.6. If you exercise for four or five days per week, it is multiplied to 1.75. If you exercise for 6 to 7 days per week, it is multiplied to 2.0. Lastly, if you are an athlete, it is multiplied to 2.3</p>

<p> Once you achieve your daily calorie intake, you may also know how much it goes to carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. 60% of those calories go to carbohydrates. 12.5% of those calories go to proteins. The last 27.5% goes to fats. </p>
