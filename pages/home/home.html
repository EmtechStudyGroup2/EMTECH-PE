  <h2> What are Calories?</h2>
  <h3> Calories are the units of measure from the energy you gain from consumables (food and drinks). The intake of calories recommended by the app are the amount of calories you should take each day to maintain your weight or to earn the weight you wish. We need calories to survive as our body breaks these calories to gain energy you need in your daily lives. An average man needs a minimum of 2,700 kcal per day while an average woman needs a minimum of 2,200 kcal per day according to the US Government but it really depends on each individual. This is why this application exists!
